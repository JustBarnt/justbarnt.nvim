## Fixes
- [ ] Which-key has issues when either disabling presets or disabling marks/registers
- [ ] Ensure that `vim.lsp_buf.code_actions` is working and integrate into Telescope if possible

### Installed and Setup to default, but need to customize
- [ ] [Telescope File Browser](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope-file-browser.nvim)
- [ ] [Nougat.nvim](https://github.com/MunifTanjim/nougat.nvim) -> Lualline
- [ ] [Detour.nvim](https://github.com/carbon-steel/detour.nvim)
    - Figured out how to redirect vim.lsp.buf actions to detour, just need to setup for the rest of the actions I want 
      redirected.

# Note
- When in a Telescope prompt `<C-S>/<C-V>` will open the current file under cursor in a split/verticly split window.
- `gx` opens a link under the cursor in your browser window. But supposedly does not work if netrw is disabled.

#### Completed
