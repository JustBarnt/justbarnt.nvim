# Note
- When in a Telescope prompt `<C-S>/<C-V>` will open the current file under cursor in a split/verticly split window.
- `gx` opens a link under the cursor in your browser window. But supposedly does not work if netrw is disabled.
- look into arrow.nvim, mikesmithgh/nvim, and hardtime.nvim

#### Completed
